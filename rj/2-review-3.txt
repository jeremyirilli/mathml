## Referee report of "mathml: Translate R Expressions to MathML and LaTeX".

## General

The re-submission following review took all the comments into account. Thank you ! Really improved version for this great article. Some of the previous review comments were about some new print method in code and this probably requires more improvement to be complete. 
This does not impact much the article content though

## Detailed comments

-   p.2 "We can include the output in a R Markdown document by specifying results="asis" in the R code chunk of R Markdown, as is done in all examples below." 
	It seems following the previous review a `knit_print` method has been implemented. This should not require `output = "asis"` anymore on chunk, but it seems it still does. Probably some improvment in the way output is printed. 
        More details in code part below. 

RESPONSE: The revised math() function does not need an "asis" option anymore.

## Code

    I think this has been improved, but it seems there is still a `cat()` applying to the output, which makes the `knitr::asis_output()` not working as it should. The `##` in the output when running `math(term)` in a chunk shows that the `cat()` applies. 
    Using `knitr::asis_output()` should allow to have a character vector as output (without `cat`-ing it), and that will be considered as a `"asis"` result by **knitr** which will print correctly. Users won't need `results= "asis"` anymore which would improve experience in my opinion.

RESPONSE: The cat was indeed in the way, thank you again for the valuable hint.

This R\ package translates R\ objects to suitable elements in MathML or LaTeX,
thereby allowing for a pretty mathematical representation of R\ objects and
functions in data analyses, scientific reports and interactive web content. In
the RMarkdown document rendering language, R\ code and mathematical content
already exist side-by-side. The present package allows to use the same
R\ objects for both data analysis and typesetting in documents or web content.
This tightens the link between the statistical analysis and its verbal
description or symbolic representation, which is another step towards
reproducible science. User-defined hooks allow to extend the package by
mapping specific variables or functions to new MathML and LaTeX entities. A
few working examples illustrate the use of the package in a scientific report.

# 1. Introduction

The R\ extension of the markdown language [@Xie2020] enables reproducible
statistical reports with nice typesetting in HTML, Microsoft Word, and Latex.
Since recently [@R, version 4.2], R\'s manual pages include support for
mathematical expressions [@Sarkar2022;@Viechtbauer2022], which already is a big
improvement. However, rules for the mapping of built-in language elements to
their mathematical representation are still lacking. So far, R\ expressions such
as `pbinom(k, N, p)` are printed as they are; pretty mathematical formulae
such as \(P_{\mathrm{Bi}}(X \le k; N, p)\) require explicit Latex commands, that
is, `P_{\mathrm{Bi}}\left(X \le k; N, p\right)`. Except for minimalistic use
cases, these commands are tedious to type in and their source code is hard to
read.

The present R\ package defines a set of rules for the automatic translation of
R\ expressions to mathematical output in RMarkdown documents [@Xie2020] and
ShinyApp webpages [@Chang2022]. The translation is done by an embedded Prolog
interpreter that maps nested expressions recursively to MathML and
LaTeX/MathJax, respectively. User-defined hooks enable to extend the set of
rules, for example, to represent specific R\ elements by custom mathematical
signs.

The main feature of the package is that the same R\ expressions and equations
can be used for both mathematical typesetting and calculations. This saves time
and reduces mistakes, as will be illustrated below.

The paper is organized as follows. Section\ 2 presents the technical background
of the package, including the two main classes of Prolog rules for translating
R\ objects to mathematical expressions. Section\ 3 illustrates the main features
of the _mathml_ package, potential issues and workarounds using examples
from the day-to-day perspective of a user. Section\ 4 present a case study for
the use of the package in a scientific report. Section\ 5 concludes with a
discussion and ideas for further development.

# 2. Background

The translation of R\ expressions to mathematical output is achieved through a
Prolog interpreter from R\ package _rolog_ [@rolog]. Prolog is a classical logic
programming language with many applications in expert systems, computer
linguistics and symbolic artificial intelligence. The main strength of Prolog is
its concise representation of facts and rules for knowledge and grammar, as well
as its efficient built-in search engine for closed world domains. As it is
well-known, R\ is a statistical programming language for data analysis and
statistical modeling. Whereas Prolog is weak in statistical computation, but
strong in symbolic manipulation, the converse may be said for the R\ language.
The _rolog_ package bridges this gap by providing an interface to a SWI-Prolog
distribution [@swipl] in R. The communication between the two systems is mainly
in the form of queries from R\ to Prolog, but two predicates allow Prolog to
ring back and evaluate terms in R.

For a first illustration of the _mathml_ package, we consider the binomial
probability.

```{r}
term <- quote(pbinom(k, N, p))
term
```

The term is quoted to avoid its immediate evaluation (which would raise an error
anyway since the variables `k`, `N`, `p` have not yet been defined). Experienced
readers will remember that the quoted expression above is a short form for

```r
term <- call("pbinom", as.name("k"), as.name("N"), as.name("p"))
```

As is seen from the output above, the variable `term` is not assigned the result
of the calculation, but an R\ call
[see, e.g., @Wickham2019, for details on "non-standard evaluation"]. Such a call
can eventually be evaluated with `eval()`,

```{r}
k <- 10
N <- 22
p <- 0.4
eval(term)
```

The R\ package _mathml_ can now be used to render the call in MathML, that
is the dialect for mathematical elements on HTML webpages or in MathJax/LaTeX,
as shown below (some of the curly braces are not really needed in this simple
example, but are necessary in edge cases).

```{r}
library(mathml)
mathjax(term)
```

We can include the output in a RMarkdown document by specifying `results='asis'`
in the R\ code chunk, as is done in the next example. The
R\ function `mathout()` has been defined in this vignette; it invokes `mathml()`
for HTML output and `mathjax()` for LaTeX output.

```{r, results='asis'}
mathout(term)
```

At the Prolog end, a predicate `math/2` translates the call `pbinom(K, N, Pi)`
into a "function" `fn/2` with the name `P_Bi`, one argument `X =< K`, and the
two parameters `N` and `Pi`.

```prolog
math(pbinom(K, N, Pi), M)
 => M = fn(subscript('P', "Bi"), (['X' =< K] ; [N, Pi])).
```

Thus, the predicate `math/2` could be considered a "macro" that translates a
mathematical element (here, `pbinom(K, N, Pi)`) to a different mathematical
element, namely `fn(Name, (Args ; Pars))`. The low-level predicate `ml/3` is
used to convert these basic elements to MathML.

```prolog
ml(Flags, fn(Name, (Args ; Pars)), M)
 => ml(Flags, Name, N),
    ml(Flags, paren(list(op(;), [list(op(','), Args), list(op(','), Pars)])), X),
    M = mrow([N, mo(&(af)), X]).
```

The relevant rule for `ml/3` builds the MathML entity `mrow([N, mo(&(af)), X])`,
with `N` representing the name of the function and `X` its arguments and
parameters, enclosed in parentheses. A corresponding rule `jax/3` does the same
for MathJax/LaTeX. A list of flags can be used for context-sensitive
translation (see, e.g., the section on errors below).

# 3. Package _mathml_ in practice

_mathml_ is an R\ package for pretty mathematical representation of
R\ functions and objects in data analysis, scientific reports and interactive
web content. The currently supported features are listed below, roughly
following the order proposed by [@murrell2000].

## Basic elements

_mathml_ handles the basic elements of everyday mathematical expressions,
such as numbers, Latin and Greek letters, multi-letter identifiers, accents,
subscripts, and superscripts. 
 
```{r, results='asis'}
term <- quote(1 + -2L + a + abc + "a" + phi + Phi + varphi + hat(b)[i, j]^2L)
mathout(term)

term <- quote(NaN + NA + TRUE + FALSE + Inf + (-Inf))
mathout(term)
```

An expression such as `1 + -2` may be considered unsatisfactory from an
aesthetical perspective. It is correct R\ syntax, though, and is reproduced
accordingly, without the parentheses. Parentheses around negated numbers or
symbols can be added as shown above for `+ (-Inf)`.

Note that an R\ function `hat()` does not exist in base R, it is provided by the
package for convenience and points to the identity function. Quite a few such
convenience functions have been defined
in _mathml_ (see, e.g., next section, and the manual for details).

## Operators and parentheses

Arithmetic operators and parentheses are translated as they are, as illustrated
below.

```{r, results="asis"}
term <- quote(a - ((b + c)) - d*e + f*(g + h) + i/j + k^(l + m) + (n*o)^{p + q})
mathout(term)

term <- quote(dot(a, b) + frac(1L, nodot(c, d + e)) + dfrac(1L, times(g, h)))
mathout(term)
```

For multiplications involving only numbers and symbols, the multiplication sign
is omitted. This heuristic does not always produce the desired result;
therefore, _mathml_ defines alternative R\ functions `dot()`, `nodot()`,
and `times()`. These functions calculate a product and produce the respective
multiplication signs. Similarly, `frac()` and `dfrac()` can be used for small
and large fractions.

For standard operators with known precedence, _mathml_ is generally able to
detect if parentheses are needed; for example, parentheses are automatically
placed around `g + h` in the `nodot`-example. However, we note unecessary
parentheses around `l + m` above. Thes parentheses are a consequence
of `quote(a^(b + c))` actually producing a nested R\ call of the
form `'^'(a, (b + c))` instead of `'^'(a, b + c)`:

```{r}
term <- quote(a^(b + c))
paste(term)
```

For the present purpose, this feature is unfortunate because extra parentheses
around `b + c` are not needed. The preferred result is obtained by using the
functional form `quote('^'(k, l + m))` of the power, or curly braces as a
workaround (see `p + q` above).

## Custom operators

Whereas in standard infix operators, the parentheses typically follow the rules
for precedence, undesirable results may be obtained in custom operators.

```{r, results='asis'}
term <- quote(mean(X) %+-% 1.96 * s / sqrt(N))
mathout(term)
term <- quote('%+-%'(mean(X), 1.96 * s / sqrt(N))) # functional form of '%+-%'
term <- quote(mean(X) %+-% {1.96 * s / sqrt(N)})   # the same
mathout(term)
```

The example is a reminder that it is not possible to define the precedence of
custom operators in R, and that expressions with such operators are evaluated
strictly from left to right. Again, the problem can be worked around by the
functional form of the operator, or a curly brace to hide the parenthesis but
enforce the correct operator precedence.

More operators are shown in Table\ 1, including the
suggestions by Murrell and Ihaka [-@murrell2000] for graphical annotations and
arrows in R\ figures.

```{r custom-operators, echo=FALSE}
op1 <- list(
  "A\\ %*%\\ B"=quote(A %*% B),
  "A\\ %.%\\ B"=quote(A %.% B),
  "A\\ %x%\\ B"=quote(A %x% B),
  "A\\ %/%\\ B"=quote(A %/% B),
  "A\\ %%\\ B"=quote(A %% B),
  "A\\ &\\ B"=quote(A & B),
  "A\\ |\\ B"=quote(A | B),
  "xor(A,\\ B)"=quote(xor(A, B)),
  "!A"=quote(!A),

op1 <- names(op1)

t <- cbind(Operator=op1, Output=m1,
  Operator=op2, Output=m2,
  Operator=op3, Arrow=m3)

knitr::kable(t, caption="Table 1. Custom operators in mathml",
  row.names=FALSE, escape=FALSE)
```

## Builtin functions

There is support for most functions from package _base_, with adequate use and
omission of parentheses.

```{r, results='asis'}
term <- quote(sin(x) + sin(x)^2L + cos(pi/2L) + tan(2L*pi) * expm1(x))
mathout(term)
term <- quote(choose(N, k) + abs(x) + sqrt(x) + floor(x) + exp(frac(x, y)))
mathout(term)
```

A few more examples are shown in Table\ 2, including functions from _stats_. 

```{r base-stats, echo=FALSE}
op1 <- list(
  "sin(x)"=quote(sin(x)),
  "cosh(x)"=quote(cosh(x)),
  "tanpi(alpha)"=quote(tanpi(alpha)),
  "asinh(alpha)"=quote(asinh(alpha)),
  "log(p)"=quote(log(p)),
  "log1p(x)"=quote(log1p(x)),
  "logb(x,\\ e)"=quote(logb(x, e)),
  "exp(x)"=quote(exp(x)),
  "expm1(x)"=quote(expm1(x)),
  "choose(n,\\ k)"=quote(choose(n, k)),
  "lchoose(n,\\ k)"=quote(lchoose(n, k)),
  "factorial(n)"=quote(factorial(n)), 
  "lfactorial(n)"=quote(lfactorial(n)),
  "sqrt(x)"=quote(sqrt(x)),
  "mean(X)"=quote(mean(X)),
  "abs(x)"=quote(abs(x)))
m1 <- lapply(op1, FUN=mathout, flags=list(cat=FALSE))

op1 <- names(op1)
if(knitr::is_latex_output())
  op1 <- sapply(op1, FUN=knitr:::escape_latex)
if(knitr::is_html_output())
  op1 <- sapply(op1, FUN=knitr:::escape_html)

op2 <- list(
  "dbinom(k,\\ N,\\ pi)"=quote(dbinom(k, N, pi)),
  "pbinom(k,\\ N,\\ pi)"=quote(pbinom(k, N, pi)),
  "qbinom(p,\\ N,\\ pi)"=quote(qbinom(p, N, pi)),

  "qchisq(1L\\ -\\ alpha,\\ 1L)"=quote(qchisq(1L-alpha, 1L)),
  "pt(t,\\ N\\ -\\ 1L)"=quote(pt(t, N-1L)),
  "qt(alpha/2L,\\ N\\ -\\ 1L)"=quote(qt(alpha/2L, N-1L)))
m2 <- lapply(op2, FUN=mathout, flags=list(cat=FALSE))

op2 <- names(op2)
if(knitr::is_latex_output())
  op2 <- sapply(op2, FUN=knitr:::escape_latex)
if(knitr::is_html_output())
  op2 <- sapply(op2, FUN=knitr:::escape_html)

t <- cbind(Function=op1, Output=m1, Function=op2, Output=m2)
knitr::kable(t, caption="Table 2. R functions from _base_ and _stats_",
  row.names=FALSE, escape=FALSE)
```

## Custom functions

For self-written functions, matters are a bit more complicated. For a function
such as `g <- function(...) ...`, the name _g_ is not transparent to R, because
only the function body is represented, as illustrated by the redefinition
of `sign` below.

```{r, results='asis'}
sgn <- function(x)
{
  if(x == 0L) return(0L)
  if(x < 0L) return(-1L)
  if(x > 0L) return(1L)
}

mathout(sgn)
mathout(call("<-", quote(sgn(x)), sgn))
```

As shown in the example, we can still display functions in the
form `head(x) = body` if we embed the object to be shown into a
call `"<-"(head, body)`.

The function body is generally a nested R\ call of the form `'{'(L)`, with `L`
being a list of commands. As illustrated in the example, _mathml_ provides
limited support for control structures such as `if`.

## Indices and powers

Indices in square brackets are rendered as subscripts, powers are rendered as
superscript. Moreover, _mathml_ defines the
functions `subscript()`, `superscript()` and `subsuperscript()` that simply
return their first argument. The other arguments serve as decorations, for
example, for summation and product signs.

```{r, results='asis'}
term <- quote(S[Y]^2L <- frac(1L, N) * sum(Y[i] - mean(Y))^2L)
mathout(term)

term <- quote(log(subsupscript(prod(L[i]), i==1L, N)) <- 
          subsupscript(sum(log(L[i])), i==1L, N))
mathout(term)
```

## Ringing back to R

R\'s `integrate` function takes a number of arguments, the most important ones
being the function to integrate, and the lower and the upper bound of the
integration.

```{r, results='asis'}
term <- quote(integrate(sin, 0L, 2L*pi))
mathout(term)
eval(term)
```

For mathematical typesetting in the form
of \(\int f(x)\, dx\), _mathml_ needs to find out the name of the
integration variable. For that purpose, the underlying Prolog bridge provides a
predicate `r_eval/3` that calls R\ from Prolog. In the example above, this
predicate evaluates `formalArgs(args(sin))`, which returns the names of the
arguments of `sin`, namely, `x`.

Note that in the example above, the quoted term is an abbreviation
for `call("integrate", quote(sin), ...)`, with `sin` being an R\ symbol, not a
function. While the R\ function `integrate()` can handle both symbols and
functions, _mathml_ needs the symbol because it is unable to determine the
function name of custom fuctions.

## Names and order of arguments

One of R's great features is the possibility to refer to function arguments by
their names, not only by their position in the list of arguments. At the other
end, Prolog does not have such a feature. Therefore, the Prolog handlers for
R\ calls are rather rigid, for example, `integrate/3` accepts exactly three
arguments in a particular order and without names, that
is, `integrate(lower=0L, upper=2L*pi, sin)`, would not print the desired result.

To "canonicalize" function calls with named arguments and arguments in unusual
order, _mathml_ provides an auxiliary R\ function `canonical(f, drop)` that
reorders the argument list of calls to known R\ functions and, 
if `drop=TRUE` (which is the default), also removes the names of the arguments.

```{r}
term <- quote(integrate(lower=0L, upper=2L*pi, sin))
canonical(term)
```

```{r, results='asis'}
mathout(canonical(term))
```

This function can be used to feed mixtures of partially named and positional
arguments into the renderer. For details, see the R\ function `match.call()`.

## Matrices and Vectors

Of course, _mathml_ also supports matrices and vectors.

```{r, results='asis'}
v <- 1:3
mathout(call("t", v))

A <- matrix(data=11:16, nrow=2, ncol=3)
B <- matrix(data=21:26, nrow=2, ncol=3)
term <- call("+", A, B)
mathout(term)
```

Note that the seemingly more convient `term <- quote(A + B)` yields \(A + B\) in
the output---instead of the desired matrix representation. This behavior is
expected because quotation of R calls also quote the components of the
call (here, _A_ and _B_).

## Short mathematical names for R symbols

In typical R\ functions, variable names are typically longer than just single
letters, which may yield unsatisfactory results in the mathematical output.

```{r, results='asis'}
term <- quote(pbinom(successes, Ntotal, prob))
mathout(term)

hook(successes, k)
hook(quote(Ntotal), quote(N), quote=FALSE)
hook(prob, pi)
mathout(term)
```

To improve the situation, _mathml_ provides a simple hook that can be used
to replace elements (e.g., verbose variable names) of the code by concise
mathematical symbols, as illustrated in the example. To simplify notation,
the `quote` flag of `hook()` defaults to TRUE, and `hook()` uses non-standard
evaluation to unpack its arguments. If quote is FALSE, as shown above, the user
has to provide the quoted expressions. Care should be taken to
avoid recursive hooks such as `hook(s, s["A"])` that endlessly replace
the \(s\) from \(s_{\mathrm{A}}\) as
in \(s_{\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{A}\cdots}}}\).

## Abbreviations

We consider the \(t\)-statistic for independent samples with equal variance. To
avoid clutter in the equation, the pooled variance \(s^2_{\mathrm{pool}}\) is
abbreviated, and a comment is given with the expression
for \(s^2_{\mathrm{pool}}\). For this purpose, _mathml_ provides a
function `denote(abbr, expr, info)`, with `expr` actually being
evaluated, `abbr` being rendered, plus a comment of the
form "with `expr` denoting `info`".

```{r, results='asis'}
hook(m_A, mean(X)["A"]) ; hook(s2_A, s["A"]^2L) ;
hook(n_A, n["A"])
hook(m_B, mean(X)["B"]) ; hook(s2_B, s["B"]^2L)
hook(n_B, n["B"]) ; hook(s2_p, s["pool"]^2L)

term <- quote(t <- dfrac(m_A - m_B, 
    sqrt(denote(s2_p, frac((n_A - 1L)*s2_A + (n_B - 1L)*s2_B, n_A + n_B - 2L),
                "the pooled variance.") * (frac(1L, n_A) + frac(1L, n_B)))))
mathout(term)
```

The term is evaluated below. `print()` is needed because the return value of an
assignment of the form `t <- dfrac(...)` is not visible in R.

```{r}
m_A <- 1.5; s2_A <- 2.4^2; n_A <- 27; m_B <- 3.9; s2_B <- 2.8^2; n_B <- 20
print(eval(term))
```

## Context-dependent rendering

Consider an educational scenario in which we want to highlight a certain
element of a term, for example, that a student has forgotten to subtract the
null hypothesis in a \(t\)-ratio:

```{r, results='asis'}
t <- quote(dfrac(omit_right(mean(D) - mu[0L]), s / sqrt(N)))
mathout(t, flags=list(error="highlight"))
mathout(t, flags=list(error="fix"))
```

The R function `omit_right(a + b)` uses non-standard evaluation
techniques [e.g., @Wickham2019] to return only the left part an operation,
and cancels the right part. This may not always be desired, for example, when
illustrating how to fix the mistake.

For this purpose, the functions `mathml()` or `mathjax()` have an optional
argument `flags` which is a list with named elements. In this example, we use
this argument to tell _mathml_ how to render such erroneous
expressions using the flag `error` which is one of asis, highlight, fix, or
ignore. For more examples, see Table 3.

```{r mistakes, echo=FALSE}
op1 <- list(
  "omit_left(a\\ +\\ b)"=quote(omit_left(a + b)),
  "omit_right(a\\ +\\ b)"=quote(omit_right(a + b)),
  "list(quote(a),\\ quote(omit(b)))"=list(quote(a), quote(omit(b))),
  "add_left(a\\ +\\ b)"=quote(add_left(a + b)),
  "add_right(a\\ +\\ b)"=quote(add_right(a + b)),
  "list(quote(a),\\ quote(add(b)))"=list(quote(a), quote(add(b))),
  "instead(a,\\ b)\\ +\\ c"=quote(instead(a, b) + c))

asis <- lapply(op1, FUN=mathout, flags=list(cat=FALSE, error="asis"))
high <- lapply(op1, FUN=mathout, flags=list(cat=FALSE, error="highlight"))
fix  <- lapply(op1, FUN=mathout, flags=list(cat=FALSE, error="fix"))
igno <- lapply(op1, FUN=mathout, flags=list(cat=FALSE, error="ignore"))

op1 <- names(op1)
if(knitr::is_latex_output())
  op1 <- sapply(op1, FUN=knitr:::escape_latex)
if(knitr::is_html_output())
  op1 <- sapply(op1, FUN=knitr:::escape_html)

t <- cbind(Operation=op1, 
  "error\\ =\\ asis"=asis, highlight=high, fix=fix, ignore=igno)
knitr::kable(t, caption="Table 3. Highlighting elements of a term",

# 4. A case study

This case study describes a model by Schwarz [-@schwarz1994] from mathematical
Psychology using the features of package _mathml_. Schwarz presents a new
explanation of redundancy gains that occur when observers respond to stimuli of
different sources, and the same information is presented on two or more
channels. In Schwarz' model, decision-making builds on a process of noisy
accumulation of information over time [e.g., @ratcliff2016]. In redundant
stimuli, the model assumes a superposition of channel-specific diffusion
processes that eventually reach an absorbing barrier to elicit the response. For
a detailed description the reader may refer to the original article.

Schwarz' [-@schwarz1994] model refers to two stimuli A and B, presented either
alone or in combination (AB, redundant stimuli), with the redundant stimuli
being presented either simultaneously or with onset asynchrony \(\tau\). The
channel activation is described as a two-dimensional Wiener process with
drifts \(\mu_i\), variances \(\sigma^2_i\), and initial
conditions \(X_i(t = 0) = 0, i = \mathrm{A, B}\). The channels may be correlated
with \(\rho_{\mathrm{AB}}\), but we assume \(\rho_{\mathrm{AB}} = 0\) for
simplicity.

A response is elicited when the process reaches an absorbing barrier \(c > 0\)
for the first time. In single-target trials, the first passages at \(c\) are
expected at

```{r, results='asis'}
ED_single <- function(c, mu)
  dfrac(c, mu)

# display as E(D; mu), c is a scaling parameter
hook(ED_single(.C, .Mu), E(`;`(D, .Mu)))
mathout(call("=", quote(ED_single(c, mu)), ED_single))
```

In redundant stimuli, the activation of the channel-specific diffusion processes
adds up, \(X_{\mathrm{AB}}(t) = X_{\mathrm A}(t) + X_{\mathrm B}(t)\), hence
the name, superposition. \(X_{\mathrm{AB}}(t)\) is again a Wiener process with
drift \(\mu_{\mathrm A} + \mu_{\mathrm B}\) and
variance \(\sigma^2_{\mathrm A} + \sigma^2_{\mathrm B}\). For the expected
first-passage time, we have

```{r, results='asis'}
hook(mu_A, mu["A"])
hook(mu_B, mu["B"])
hook(sigma_A, sigma["A"])
hook(sigma_B, sigma["B"])
hook(mu_M, mu["M"])
hook(M, overline(X))

mathout(call("=", quote(E(D["AB"])), quote(ED_single(c, mu_A + mu_B))))
```

For asynchronous stimuli, Schwarz [-@schwarz1994; Eq. 10] derived the expected
first-passage time as a function of the stimulus onset asyncrony \(\tau\),

```{r, results="asis"}
ED_async <- function(tau, c, mu_A, sigma_A, mu_B)
{ dfrac(c, mu_A) + (dfrac(1L, mu_A) - dfrac(1L, mu_A + mu_B)) *
    ((mu_A*tau - c) * pnorm(dfrac(c - mu_A*tau, sqrt(sigma_A^2L*tau)))
      - (mu_A*tau + c) * exp(dfrac(2L*c*mu_A, sigma_A^2L))
        * pnorm(dfrac(-c - mu_A*tau, sqrt(sigma_A^2L*tau))))
}

hook(ED_async(.Tau, .C, .MA, .SA, .MB), E(`;`(D[.Tau], `,`(.MA, .SA, .MB))))
mathout(call("=", quote(ED_async(tau, c, mu_A, sigma_A, mu_B)), ED_async))
```

For negative onset asynchrony (i.e., B before A), the parameters need to be
switched.

```{r, results='asis'}
ED <- function(tau, c, mu_A, sigma_A, mu_B, sigma_B)
{
  if(tau == Inf) return(ED_single(c, mu_A)) ;
  if(tau == -Inf) return(ED_single(c, mu_B)) ;
  if(tau == 0L) return(ED_single(c, mu_A + mu_B)) ;
  if(tau > 0L) return(ED_async(tau, c, mu_A, sigma_A, mu_B)) ;
  if(tau < 0L) return(ED_async(abs(tau), c, mu_B, sigma_B, mu_A))
}

hook(ED(.Tau, .C, .MA, .SA, .MB, .SB), E(`;`(D[.Tau], `,`(.MA, .SA, .MB, .SB))))
mathout(call("=", quote(ED(tau, c, mu_A, sigma_A, mu_B, sigma_B)), ED))
```

The observable response time is assumed to be the sum of \(D\), the time
employed to reach the threshold for the decision, and a residual \(M\) denoting
other processes such a motor preparation and execution. Correspondingly, the
expected response time amounts to

```{r, results='asis'}
ET <- function(tau, c, mu_A, sigma_A, mu_B, sigma_B, mu_M)
  ED(tau, c, mu_A, sigma_A, mu_B, sigma_B) + mu_M

hook(ET(.Tau, .C, .MA, .SA, .MB, .SB, .MM), 
     E(`;`(T[.Tau], `,`(.MA, .SA, .MB, .SB, .MM))))
mathout(call("=", quote(E(T[tau])), ET))
```

Schwarz [-@schwarz1994] applied the model to data from a redundant signals task
with 13 onset
asynchronies \(0, \pm33, \pm67, \pm100, \pm133, \pm167, \pm\infty\) ms,
where \(0\) refers to the synchronous condition, and \(\pm\infty\) to the
single-target presentations. Each condition was replicated 400 times. The
observed mean response times and their standard deviations are given in
Table 4 below.

```{r miller-data, echo=FALSE}
tau  <- list(-Inf, -167L, -133L, -100L, -67L, -33L, 0L, 33L, 67L, 100L, 133L, 167L, Inf)
m    <- c(231, 234, 230, 227, 228, 221, 217, 238, 263, 277, 298, 316, 348)
s    <- c( 56,  58,  40,  40,  32,  28,  28,  28,  26,  30,  32,  34,  92)
n    <- c(400, 400, 400, 400, 400, 400, 400, 400, 400, 400, 400, 400, 400)

ttau <- lapply(tau, FUN=mathout, flags=list(cat=FALSE))
tm   <- lapply(as.integer(m), FUN=mathout, flags=list(cat=FALSE))
ts   <- lapply(as.integer(s), FUN=mathout, flags=list(cat=FALSE))
tn   <- lapply(as.integer(n), FUN=mathout, flags=list(cat=FALSE))

t <- cbind('$\\tau$'=ttau, '$m$'=tm, '$s$'=ts, '$n$'=tn)
knitr::kable(t, caption="Table 4. Miller data", row.names=FALSE, escape=FALSE)
```

Assuming that the model is correct, the observable mean reaction times follow an
approximate Normal distribution around the model prediction \(E(T)\). We can,
therefore, use a standard goodness-of-fit measure by \(z\)-standardisation.

```{r, results='asis'}
z <- function(m, s, n, tau, c, mu_A, sigma_A, mu_B, sigma_B, mu_M)
  dfrac(m - denote(E, ET(tau, c, mu_A, sigma_A, mu_B, sigma_B, mu_M),
              "the expected mean response time"),
    s / sqrt(n))

mathout(call("=", quote(z[tau]), z))
```

The overall goodness-of-fit is the sum of the squared \(z\)-statistics for each
onset asynchrony. Assuming again that the architecture of the model is correct,
but the parameters are adjusted to the data, it follows
a \(\chi^2(8~\mathrm{df})\)-distribution.

```{r, results='asis'}
zv <- Vectorize(z, vectorize.args = c('m', 's', 'n', 'tau'))

gof <- function(par, tau, m, s, n)
  sum(zv(m, s, n, tau, c=100L, mu_A=par["mu_A"], sigma_A=par["sigma_A"], 
         mu_B=par["mu_B"], sigma_B=par["sigma_B"], mu_M=par["mu_M"])^2L)

hook(zv(.M, .S, .N, .Tau, .C, .MA, .SA, .MB, .SB, .MM), z[.Tau])
mathout(call("=", quote(X["8 df"]^2L), gof))
```

The degrees of freedom result from the 13 predicted mean response times, 
minus 5 free parameters
\(\theta = \langle\mu_{\mathrm A}, \sigma_{\mathrm A}, \mu_{\mathrm B}, \sigma_{\mathrm B}, \mu_{\mathrm M}\rangle\)
(\(c\) is a redundant scaling parameter).

```{r, results="asis", echo=FALSE}
lsq <- function(tau, m, s, n)
{
  invisible(theta <- c(mu_A=0.53, sigma_A=4.3, mu_B=1.34, sigma_B=11.7, mu_M=160))
  optim(theta, gof, tau=tau, m=m, s=s, n=n, hessian=TRUE)
}

mathout(call("=", quote(hat(theta)), lsq))
```

The best fitting parameter values and their confidence intervals are given in
Table 5 below.

```{r params, echo=FALSE}
fit <- lsq(tau, m, s, n)
theta <- fit$par
se <- sqrt(diag(solve(fit$hessian)))
cilo <- qnorm(0.025, theta, se)
ciup <- qnorm(0.975, theta, se)

ntheta <- lapply(lapply(FUN=as.symbol, names(theta)), FUN=mathout, flags=list(cat=FALSE))
ttheta <- lapply(theta, FUN=mathout, flags=list(cat=FALSE))
tcilo <- lapply(cilo, FUN=mathout, flags=list(cat=FALSE))
tciup <- lapply(ciup, FUN=mathout, flags=list(cat=FALSE))

t <- cbind(Parameter=ntheta, Estimate=ttheta, Lo=tcilo, Up=tciup)
knitr::kable(t, caption="Table 5. Model fit", row.names=FALSE, escape=FALSE)
```

The statistic goodness-of-fit value is \(X^2(8) = 30.54\), \(p = .0002\), 
indicating some lack of fit. Given the large trial numbers in the original
study, some lack of fit is expected. For more detail, especially on fitting the
observed standard deviations, the reader is referred to the original
paper [@schwarz1994].

# 5. Conclusions

This package expands the possibilities of R\ by allowing calculations and
graphical rendering of the same terms. Building on current features of R\ and
existing packages for displaying formulas in
R\ [@murrell2000;@allaire2018]), the _mathml_ package bridges the gap
between computational needs, presentation of results, and their reproducibility.
Two possible modes for typesetting are available to export R\ Markdown documents
in different formats or ShinyApp webpages: MathML and MathJax. A further, not-yet-mentioned, use of _mathml_ is related to presentations made using
RMarkdown. By adopting _mathml_ researchers or teachers can use the
RMarkdown to both conduct analysis and show results, smoothing the process and
uniforming the graphical output.

The case study presented above shows that _mathml_ can help to improve
data analyses and statistical reports from an aesthetical perspective, as well
as regarding reproducibility of research. Furthermore, the package may also
allow for a better detection of possible mistakes in R programs.

Similar to most programming languages [@green1977], R\ code is notoriously hard
to read, and the poor legibility of the language is one of the main sources of
mistakes. For illustration, we consider again Equation 10 in
Schwarz [-@schwarz1994].

````{r, results="asis"}
f1 <- function(tau)
{ dfrac(c, mu["A"]) + (dfrac(1L, mu["A"]) - dfrac(1L, mu["A"] + mu["B"]) * 
    ((mu["A"]*tau - c) * pnorm(dfrac(c - mu["A"]*tau, sqrt(sigma["A"]^2L*tau)))
      - (mu["A"]*tau + c) * exp(dfrac(2L*mu["A"]*tau, sigma["A"]^2L))
        * pnorm(dfrac(-c - mu["A"]*tau, sqrt(sigma["A"]^2L*tau)))))
}

mathout(f1)
````

The first version has a wrong parenthesis, which is barely visible in the code,
whereas the wrong curly brace in the mathematical representation is immediately
obvious. The correct version is shown below for comparison.

````{r, results="asis"}
f2 <- function(tau)
{ dfrac(c, mu["A"]) + (dfrac(1L, mu["A"]) - dfrac(1L, mu["A"] + mu["B"])) * 
    ((mu["A"]*tau - c) * pnorm(dfrac(c - mu["A"]*tau, sqrt(sigma["A"]^2L*tau)))
      - (mu["A"]*tau + c) * exp(dfrac(2L*mu["A"]*tau, sigma["A"]^2L))
        * pnorm(dfrac(-c - mu["A"]*tau, sqrt(sigma["A"]^2L*tau))))
}

mathout(f2)
````

As the reader may know from own experience, missed parentheses are frequent
causes of wrong results and errors that are hard to locate in programming code.
This particular example shows that mathematical rendering can help to
substantially reduce the amount of careless errors in programming.

In its current version _mathml_ has some limitations. For example, it is
currently not possible to use the functions of _mathml_ for writing
intratextual formulas, here, the user has to adopt the usual LateX notation.
However, we do not consider this to be a serious limitation, since the most
productive use of _mathml_ still comes from more complicated calculations.

Also: In long equations, we did not yet find a convenient way to insert
linebreaks. This is mostly because it is not properly supported by MathML and
LaTeX renderers. In its current stage, the LaTeX package _breqn_ [@breqn]
is mostly a proof of concept.

_mathml_ is available for R\ version (…) and later, and can be easily
installed using the usual `install.packages("mathml")`. The source code of the
package is found at https://github.com/mgondan/mathml.
